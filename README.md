"# close-to-100---cube-game-exe"

Rules of the game:

There are two players.
On a player's turn, he can choose:
1. Roll two dice (6 sides) → The sum of the roll is added to his cumulative score.
2. Pass the turn to the other player (without changing the score).

* Goal: reach 100 without going over 100.
* If after the roll the player's score exceeds 100 → the player is disqualified and the other player wins immediately.

* If both players pass after each other (two consecutive Passes) → the game ends; the winner is the one who is closer to 100

* If at the end of the game (after two consecutive Passes) there is a tie in the score → each player rolls two dice once; the one who got a higher result in the attempt wins. If there is a tie here too → such rounds of decision continue until there is a winner.

* If a player reaches exactly 100 after the roll — that player wins immediately
